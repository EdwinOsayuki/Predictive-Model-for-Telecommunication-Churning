Telecommunications companies are usually not the most popular companies with consumers and Customer loyalty is the key to profitability in the telecom industry. People often express frustration with the performance of service providers, whether it's complicated billing, spam marketing emails, difficult customer service, internet speed, connectivity, or high plans. As a result, it is not surprising to learn that telecommunications companies have a high customer churn rate.
